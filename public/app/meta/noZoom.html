    You can't zoom in if you set user-scalable=no
    <br/><br/>
    Try re-enabling zoom by adjusting the meta tag.

    **NOTE** - if you look at this example on a mobile phone, you will probably not see any change to the zoom level with the automatic refresh. This is because the mobile browsers save your current zoom level when you refresh. To see the full effect of your changes, click into the url bar and press 'go' or 'enter' (depending on your browser).
