    <div style="width: 100%" class="pretty">
        This div will change sizes as the screen changes size. This is fantastic for responsive web design.

    <div style="width: 300px" class="pretty">
        This div will NOT change size. This leads to a poor experience on devices of different sizes because it
        is basically only designed to work on one screen size.
